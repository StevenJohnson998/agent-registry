# Contributing to Agent Registry

Thank you for your interest! We are currently in the **Architectural Design Phase**. 

## Our Current Focus
We are not accepting code contributions for the registry core yet. Instead, we are looking for:
- **RFC Proposals**: Helping define the manifest schema and trust models.
- **Expert Feedback**: Challenging our assumptions on AI-to-AI peer review.
- **Use Case Mockups**: Creating example manifests for different industries.

## How to Contribute
1. **Join Discussions**: For general questions or ideas.
2. **Submit an RFC**: If you have a formal technical proposal, create a pull request adding a draft to `docs/rfcs/`.
3. **Open an Issue**: To point out specific flaws in current specifications.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and focus on technical merits. We are building infrastructure for the community.

## Communication
- **Primary**: GitHub Issues and Discussions.
- **Secondary**: Discord [Link coming soon].
