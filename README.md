## The Problem

AI agents are multiplying. An orchestrator handling a financial analysis task might have 50 agents to choose from — but no good way to decide:

- **Which agent is the best for this specific task?** Not a generic rating — proven quality at *this* capability.
- **What will it do with my data?** Will it train on it? Store it? Forward it to a third party?
- **Is it compliant with the regulations I care about?** GDPR, HIPAA, POPIA, CCPA — can I filter by that?
- **Who's behind this agent?** Is there a verified, accountable organization operating it?
- **What's the most cost-effective option** at the trust level I need?
- **If it delegates to another agent, will the privacy and compliance chain hold?**

Today, registries catalog agents. None of them answer these questions. **Agent Registry** is an open-source trust layer that does. We don't replace [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) or [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/) — we complement them. MCP connects agents to tools. A2A lets agents talk to each other. **We help agents decide *who* to trust.**

## What We're Building

### 1. Agent Data Handling Policy (ADHP)

A standardized way for agents to declare what happens to your data — and for orchestrators to filter agents based on those declarations.

Five levels, from `open` (no guarantees) to `zero-trace` (streaming only, no storage, no logs, no delegation):

| Level | Training | Persistence | Logging | Delegation | Third-Party Sharing |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **open** | Yes | Unlimited | Full | Unrestricted | Allowed |
| **standard** | No | Session | Metadata only | Same level+ | With consent |
| **sensitive** | No | Request only | Metadata only | Declared only | Anonymized only |
| **strict** | No | Request only | None | Same level+ | Not allowed |
| **zero-trace** | No | None | None | None | Not allowed |

**Key innovation: Delegation Cascading.** When Agent A delegates to Agent B, the data handling level must be maintained or strengthened — never weakened. The registry validates the entire chain.

**Privacy legislation compliance tags.** Agents declare which regulations they comply with — `GDPR`, `HIPAA`, `CCPA`, `POPIA`, `PIPEDA`, `LGPD`, and others. Orchestrators filter by regulation: *"find me an agent compliant with GDPR and HIPAA that handles data at strict level."*

### 2. Operator Verification (KYC)

Trust requires accountability. We verify the organizations behind agents through tiered verification:

| Tier | What's Verified | Badge |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Unverified | Nothing — self-registered | — |
| Email-verified | Valid email confirmed | ✉️ |
| Identity-verified | Legal identity confirmed via documents | ✅ |
| Audited | Identity + technical ADHP compliance audit | 🛡️ |

Orchestrators can combine filters: *"find me an agent with ADHP ≥ sensitive AND verification ≥ identity-verified."*

### 3. Per-Capability Trust Scoring

A flat rating is useless. An agent might be excellent at financial analysis but poor at creative writing. Our registry stores **contextual trust maps** — quality and confidence scores per capability.

```
GET /agents?capability=financial-analysis&min_quality=4.0&adhp_level=strict&jurisdiction=EU&compliance=GDPR
```

## How It Fits In the Ecosystem

We're not competing with existing projects — we're filling a gap that none of them address:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Agentic Ecosystem                  │
│                                                      │

│  Agent Registry ─── WHO DO I TRUST? ◄── you are here │
│    ├── ADHP: what happens to my data?                │
│    ├── Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, POPIA...      │
│    ├── KYC: who's behind this agent?                 │
│    ├── Trust scores: is it good at THIS task?        │
│    └── Delegation chains: will trust hold?           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

We plan to **federate with the official MCP Registry** — pulling server metadata and adding our trust layer on top. We support both MCP and A2A protocols. We're compatible with AAIF standards.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/StevenJohnson998/agent-registry.git
cd agent-registry

# Start (requires Docker)
./batch/run-dev.sh

# API available at http://localhost:8000
# Dashboard at http://localhost:8000/dashboard
# Docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

# Run tests
./batch/run-tests.sh

# Seed example agents
./batch/seed-db.sh
```

### Register an Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agents \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "FinanceAnalyzer Pro",
    "description": "Financial document analysis with strict privacy",
    "capabilities": ["financial-analysis", "document-parsing"],
    "endpoint": "https://api.finanalyzer.example.com",
    "protocol": "REST",
    "data_handling": {
      "level": "strict",
      "training_opt_out": true,
      "max_retention": "request",
      "content_logging": false,
      "delegation_policy": "same_or_higher",
      "jurisdiction": ["DE", "FR"],
      "compliance": ["GDPR"],
      "third_party_sharing": { "enabled": false }
    }
  }'
```

### Find Agents by Trust Requirements

```bash
# Find strict+ agents in the EU, GDPR-compliant, that don't share data
curl "http://localhost:8000/agents?min_data_handling_level=strict&jurisdiction=EU&compliance=GDPR&third_party_sharing=false"
```

## Contributing

We're especially looking for feedback on:

- **ADHP Specification** — Are the five levels right? What data handling concerns are we missing?
- **Ecosystem integration** — How should we best work with MCP and A2A?
- **Real-world testing** — Do you operate agents? We'd love to register them and test our assumptions.
