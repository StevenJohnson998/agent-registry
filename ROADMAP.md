# Agent Registry — Project Roadmap

> Last updated: February 2026

## Vision

Build the "DNS for AI agents" — a service discovery registry where orchestrators can dynamically discover, evaluate, and invoke specialized micro-agents based on capability, reliability, and **data handling trust**.

---

## Phase 1 — Curated MVP (Current)

**Goal:** A working registry with basic CRUD, search, authentication, and the ADHP data handling framework.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| REST API (FastAPI) | 🔨 In Progress | Register, search, update, delete agents |
| PostgreSQL storage | 🔨 In Progress | Persistent agent data with JSONB for flexible fields |
| API key authentication | 🔨 In Progress | Write operations require API key, reads are public |
| Rate limiting | 🔨 In Progress | Prevent abuse |
| Keyword search | 🔨 In Progress | Search by name, description, capabilities |
| Data Handling Policy (ADHP) | 🔨 In Progress | Agents declare data handling level (open → zero-trace) |
| ADHP search filters | 🔨 In Progress | Filter agents by minimum confidentiality level, jurisdiction, third-party sharing |
| Web dashboard | 🔨 In Progress | Simple HTML page to browse and search agents |
| Docker deployment | 🔨 In Progress | Containerized with Docker Compose |
| Unit tests | 🔨 In Progress | >80% coverage with pytest |
| OpenAPI documentation | 🔨 In Progress | Auto-generated by FastAPI |
| Seed data | 🔨 In Progress | 3-5 example agents for demo |

**Milestone:** MVP deployed and accessible via HTTP.

## Phase 2 — MCP Integration & Enhanced Discovery

**Goal:** Native MCP support so orchestrators can query the registry as an MCP tool, plus semantic search.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| MCP server interface | 📋 Planned | Registry queryable via MCP protocol |
| Vector/semantic search | 📋 Planned | Match orchestrator intent to agent capability using embeddings |
| Agent health monitoring | 📋 Planned | Periodic pings to verify registered agents are alive |
| Capability taxonomy | 📋 Planned | Standardized capability tags (auto-suggested) |
| Delegation chain validation | 📋 Planned | Verify that sub-agents maintain confidentiality levels |
| Webhook notifications | 📋 Planned | Notify subscribers when matching agents are registered |
| External auth integration | 📋 Planned | Integrate with authorization system for who-can-do-what |

---

## Phase 3 — Trust & Verification

**Goal:** Move from self-declaration to verified trust, enabling monetization.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Verified badge system | 📋 Planned | Organizations pay for verification of their agents |
| KYC for agent operators | 📋 Planned | Identity verification for organizations behind agents |
| ADHP compliance audit | 📋 Planned | Technical audit that agent behavior matches declared policy |
| Reputation scoring | 📋 Planned | Contextual trust maps (reliability per capability) |
| Automated auditor agents | 📋 Planned | AI agents that test and verify other agents |
| Semantic tagging by auditors | 📋 Planned | Auto-generated and updated capability tags |

**Monetization:** Verified badge fees, premium listing, compliance audit services.

---

## Phase 4 — Autonomous Ecosystem

**Goal:** Fully autonomous peer-to-peer evaluation and decentralized trust.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| AI-native discovery | 📋 Planned | High-dimensional vector embeddings for intent matching |
| Peer-to-peer reputation | 📋 Planned | Agents rate each other based on interaction quality |
| Collusion-resistant evaluation | 📋 Planned | Fair, blind cross-validation protocols |
| Cryptographic verification | 📋 Planned | Encrypted envelopes, proofs of deletion, secure enclaves |
| Federated registries | 📋 Planned | Multiple registries that sync and cross-reference |
